## Notes

* Day 1 : I'm no regex wizard so I had to find a workaround to handle matches overlap in part two.
* Day 2 : a quick and easy one
* Day 3 : knowning where indexes start and stop is hard ðŸ¤£
* Day 4 : what a lucky elf!
* Day 5 : part two was a great opportunity to use `Range`, I can't believe I got it right on the first try!
* Day 6 : solved by brute force but we should be able to find an analytical solution. After all it's just a quadratic equation. UPDATE : went for it!
* Day 7 : ordering everything.
