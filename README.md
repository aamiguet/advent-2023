## Notes

* Day 1 : I'm no regex wizard so I had to find a workaround to handle matches overlap in part two.
* Day 2 : a quick and easy one
* Day 3 : knowning where indexes start and stop is hard 🤣
* Day 4 : what a lucky elf!
* Day 5 : part two was a great opportunity to use `Range`, I can't believe I got it right on the first try!
* Day 6 : solved by brute force but we should be able to find an analytical solution. After all it's just a quadratic equation. UPDATE : went for it!
* Day 7 : ordering everything.
* Day 8 : keeping part two for later.
* Day 9 : part two: ok let's copy-paste and change signs 😂.
* Day 10 : well I hope I won't have to read my implementation for part two ever again!
* Day 11 : why do I keep trying with `Int`? `Long` is always the solution!
* Day 12 : a bit of cache can do wonders but still far from an optimized solution.
* Day 13 : we don't really need to fix the smudge.
